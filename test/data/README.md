Minimal test data for unit testing RNASeq pipeline.  4 single end reads files (2 experimental conditions) where reads were determined to fall inside positions 10400000 to 10600000 of Arabidopsis chromosome 1.  The file at_chrom1_section.gbk is an edited version of chromsome one which has been clipped to that region.  This can be uploaded as a KBase genome.
